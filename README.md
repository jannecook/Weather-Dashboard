# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This weather application is meant to provide the current forecast for a city that a user searches. This functionality is intended to better allow the user to plan for weather conditions as they travel. It is also intended to allow the user to easily reference cities searched in the past.

This application leverages the OpenWeather API and the 5 day forecast provided there. Working on this application has provided me with experience working with 3rd party API data and local storage functions.
